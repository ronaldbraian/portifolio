            <p class=" apresentacao__conteudo__texto">Hello, I'm Ronald Braian, an extremely motivated and dedicated individual, always focused on developing my skills and growing professionally. Currently, I am pursuing Systems Analysis and Development (since January 2024), and I have a background in Administration Technician (2016-2020). My language skills include Advanced English (2013-2016), and I also have Basic Microsoft 365 knowledge (2017-2018).</p>
            <p class=" apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> Throughout my career, I've gained valuable experience in customer service and sales, including roles at Mar e Sol Variedades (Salesman) and Biro do Uniforme (Sales Assistant). In these positions, I honed my communication and networking skills, and I became adept at both team-based and independent work, thriving under pressure.</p>
            <p class=" apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> As I continue to enhance my technical abilities, I have acquired knowledge in Programming Logic (01/2024), JavaScript (02/2024), HTML and CSS (03/2024 - 05/2024), and Iâ€™m currently working on Web JavaScript (06/2024), Node.js (07/2024), and expanding my expertise in Python and SQL.I am always open to new challenges and collaborations, eager to contribute my growing skill set to help bring ideas to life.</p>
